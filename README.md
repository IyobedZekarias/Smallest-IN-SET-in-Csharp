# Smallest-IN-SET

This is a c# program that will find the smallest number in a set of numbers while prioritizing run time

If run time is being prioritized numbering the set from smallest to largest then finding the number in a position would take to long
So this program finds a number in a certain position then checks the number beside it in the set 
If the number beside it is larger nothing happens and it moves on. If the number beside it is smaller than it switches it with a number on the right side that should be smaller 
It continues the process until the number in the selected position is the right number regardless of if the other numbers are in the right position
